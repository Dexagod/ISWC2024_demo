## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
Recent reactionary incentives against
the platformization of the Web 
[](cite:cites helmond_platformization_2015)
focus on interoperable data sharing over
decentralized data stores on the Web.
<!-- Need         -->
To mimic the success of Web platforms in 
their ability to automate integration of
large amounts of data, a translation is 
required of trust flows internal to Web
platforms into the network architecture
of these decentralized data stores.
<!-- Task -->
<!-- contained within need -->
<!-- Object       -->
We present a minimal network architecture 
based on open Web standards that can
model the necessary trust requirements
based on a sample use case.
<!-- Findings - todo: rewrite    -->
The presented architecture succeeds in
modeling the required trust flows based
on a combination of open Web specifications.
<!-- Conclusion - todo: rewrite   -->
Through decoupling data storage and authorization
systems in a decentralized network architecture,
the required trust flows are explicitly captured 
in the exchanges in the architecture, leading to
a design that can scale and evolve.
<!-- Perspectives - todo: rewrite -->
In future work we will iterate on the individual
components of the architecture to improve upon 
trust flows requirements to tackle future use cases.

## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
<!-- todo: return to old abstract for contextualization? -->
The evolution of the Web has seen the rise of
platformization [](cite:cites helmond_platformization_2015)
and the concern for their power and potential misuse 
of private user data [](cite:cites hu_cambridge_2020).
In the wake of this evolution, a push for decentralization
has taken place, building interoperable architectures
that build on decentralized networks of data stores.
<!-- Need         -->
Where these efforts focus mainly on
translating the storage and sharing 
capabilities of Web platforms, 
more research is needed on
their capability to automate 
integration of network data.
<!-- Task -->
This capability for automated integration
of data relies on automating trust flows
in the architecture of the decentralized
network of data stores.
<!-- Object       -->
In this demo, we present a prototype
for a minimal network architecture
based on open Web standards that can
model these trust flows
based on a sample use case.
<!-- Findings - todo: rewrite    -->
Through decoupling data storage and authorization
components, these components can scale
separately with their requirements
for trust and functionality.
<!-- Conclusion - todo: rewrite   -->
The prototype demonstrates the architecture
enables automated integration, but requires
additional work to provide formalization
and functionality for use cases that go
beyond the context credentials can model.
<!-- Perspectives - todo: rewrite -->
Future research on this can happen individually
for the data modeling and storage components
and the governance components, providing 
opportunities for scalable iteration.

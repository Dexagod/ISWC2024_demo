## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
<!-- todo: return to old abstract for contextualization? -->
Recent traction in decentralization efforts
against the platformization of the Web 
[](cite:cites helmond_platformization_2015)
takes the form of interoperable architectures
for decentralized networks of data stores.
<!-- Need         -->
Where these efforts focus mainly on
translating the storage and sharing 
capabilities of Web platforms, 
little research has been done to 
their capability for automated 
integration of internalized data.
<!-- Task -->
This capability for automated integration
of data relies on automating trust flows
in the architecture of the decentralized
network of data stores.
<!-- Object       -->
In this demo, we present a prototype
for such a minimal network architecture
based on open Web standards that can
model these trust flows
based on a sample use case.
<!-- Findings - todo: rewrite    -->
The presented architecture succeeds in
modeling the required trust flows based
on a combination of open Web specifications.
<!-- Conclusion - todo: rewrite   -->
Through decoupling data storage and authorization
systems in a decentralized network architecture,
the required trust flows are explicitly captured 
in the exchanges in the architecture, leading to
a design that can scale and evolve.
<!-- Perspectives - todo: rewrite -->
In future work we will iterate on the individual
components of the architecture to improve upon 
trust flows requirements to tackle future use cases.

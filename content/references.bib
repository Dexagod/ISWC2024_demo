Recently, the management of the COVID 19 crisis highlighted the power of digital tools and their impact on stakes such as privacy, surveillance, transparency, and censorship. How nations deal with massive digitalization and master the technologies, and applications that are deployed and used on their soils by their companies and citizens is vividly raised by the U.S. ban on Huawei enforced by the “clean network” strategy. This ban could have set the ground for a technology war between “2 blocks: the digital democracies and the techno-authoritarian regimes” [1], [2].},

	abstract = {This paper presents Solid, a decentralized platform for social Web applications. In Solid, users’ data is managed independently of the applications that create and consume this data. The user’s data is stored in a Web-accessible personal online datastore (or pod). Solid allows users to have one or more pods from diﬀerent pod providers, while at the same time enabling users to easily switch between providers. Developers can use Solid protocols, which is based on existing W3C recommendations, for reading, writing and access control of the contents of users’ pods. In Solid architecture, applications can operate over data owned by the user or the user has access to regardless the location of this data on the Web. Users can also control access to their data, and have the option to switch between applications at any time. This is paradigm shift in integrating social features into Web applications. Our new paradigm produces a novel line of social applications. We have used Semantic Web technologies to build Solid prototypes, allowing us to demonstrate its utility through a set of applications for common day-to-day tasks. We also conduct experiments to show the scalability of the Solid prototypes.},

I explore this shift with a historical perspective on, what I refer to as, platformization, or the rise of the platform as the dominant infrastructural and economic model of the social web and its consequences. Platformization entails the extension of social media platforms into the rest of the web and their drive to make external web data “platform ready.” The specific technological architecture and ontological distinctiveness of platforms will be examined by taking their programmability into account. I position platformization as a form of platform critique that inquires into the dynamics of the decentralization of platform features and the recentralization of “platform ready” data as a way to examine the consequences of the programmability of social media platforms for the web.},

	abstract = {XML and RDF are the current standards for establishing semantic interoperability on the Web, but XML addresses only document structure. RDF better facilitates interoperation because it provides a data model that can be extended to address sophisticated ontology representation techniques. We explain the role of ontologies in the architecture of the Semantic Web. We then briefly summarize key elements of XML and RDF, showing why using XML as a tool for semantic interoperability will be ineffective in the long run. We argue that a further representation and inference layer is needed on top of the Web's current layers, and to establish such a layer, we propose a general method for encoding ontology representation languages into RDF/RDF schema. We illustrate the extension method by applying it to Ontology Interchange Language, an ontology representation and inference language.},

	abstract = {The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is in effect since May of 2018. As one of the most comprehensive pieces of legislation concerning privacy, it sparked a lot of discussion on the effect it would have on users and providers of online services in particular, due to the large amount of personal data processed in this context. Almost three years later, we are interested in revisiting this question to summarize the impact this new regulation has had on actors in the World Wide Web. Using Scopus, we obtain a vast corpus of academic work to survey studies related to changes on websites since and around the time the GDPR went into force. Our findings show that the emphasis on privacy increased w.r.t. online services, but plenty potential for improvements remains. Although online services are on average more transparent regarding data processing practices in their public data policies, a majority of these policies still either lack information required by the GDPR (e.g., contact information for users to file privacy inquiries) or do not provide this information in a user-friendly form. Additionally, we summarize that online services more often provide means for their users to opt out of data processing, but regularly obstruct convenient access to such means through unnecessarily complex and sometimes illegitimate interface design. Our survey further details that this situation contradicts the preferences expressed by users both verbally and through their actions, and researchers have proposed multiple approaches to facilitate GDPR-conform data processing without negatively impacting the user experience. Thus, we compiled reoccurring points of criticism by privacy researchers and data protection authorities into a list of four guidelines for service providers to consider.},

Recently, the management of the COVID 19 crisis highlighted the power of digital tools and their impact on stakes such as privacy, surveillance, transparency, and censorship. How nations deal with massive digitalization and master the technologies, and applications that are deployed and used on their soils by their companies and citizens is vividly raised by the U.S. ban on Huawei enforced by the “clean network” strategy. This ban could have set the ground for a technology war between “2 blocks: the digital democracies and the techno-authoritarian regimes” [1], [2].},

	abstract = {This paper presents Solid, a decentralized platform for social Web applications. In Solid, users’ data is managed independently of the applications that create and consume this data. The user’s data is stored in a Web-accessible personal online datastore (or pod). Solid allows users to have one or more pods from diﬀerent pod providers, while at the same time enabling users to easily switch between providers. Developers can use Solid protocols, which is based on existing W3C recommendations, for reading, writing and access control of the contents of users’ pods. In Solid architecture, applications can operate over data owned by the user or the user has access to regardless the location of this data on the Web. Users can also control access to their data, and have the option to switch between applications at any time. This is paradigm shift in integrating social features into Web applications. Our new paradigm produces a novel line of social applications. We have used Semantic Web technologies to build Solid prototypes, allowing us to demonstrate its utility through a set of applications for common day-to-day tasks. We also conduct experiments to show the scalability of the Solid prototypes.},

	abstract = {Web 2.0 technologies have made it possible to migrate traditional desktop applications to the Web, resulting in a rich and dynamic user experience and in expanded functionality. Individuals can create and manage their content online, and they are not only consumers of Web services, but also active participants on the Web platform. As a result, potentially large amounts of personal, sensitive, and valuable data is put online, spread across various Web services. Users sometimes share this data with other users and services on the Web, but are also concerned about maintaining privacy and sharing their data securely.Currently, users must use diverse access control solutions available for each Web service to secure data and control its dissemination. When such mechanisms are used on a daily basis, they add considerable overhead, especially since these mechanisms often lack sophistication with respect to functionality as well as user interfaces. To alleviate this problem, we discuss a novel approach to access management for Web resources that includes a user as a core part of its model. The proposal puts the user in charge of assigning access rights to resources that may be hosted at various Web applications. It facilitates the ability of users to share data more selectively using a centralized authorization manager which makes access decisions based on user instructions.},

I explore this shift with a historical perspective on, what I refer to as, platformization, or the rise of the platform as the dominant infrastructural and economic model of the social web and its consequences. Platformization entails the extension of social media platforms into the rest of the web and their drive to make external web data “platform ready.” The specific technological architecture and ontological distinctiveness of platforms will be examined by taking their programmability into account. I position platformization as a form of platform critique that inquires into the dynamics of the decentralization of platform features and the recentralization of “platform ready” data as a way to examine the consequences of the programmability of social media platforms for the web.},

## Guiding use case
{:#use_case}

To contextualize this translation
effort, a guiding use case and its 
trust flow requirements are presented: 
<!-- use case -->
A service integrating with the network
of decentralized data stores must be able
to automate the integration of age to
enable restricted functionality.

<!-- Platforms -->
For a Web platform, an integrating 
service can make use of the following
internal trust flows between the
service, registered users and the
platform to automate integration:
(i) 
The service trusts the platform
to have verified the user age
when storing it internally as
a verified age.
(ii) 
The user trusts the platform to 
enforce governance requirements
according to their preference 
settings and legal requirements.
(iii) 
The service trusts that their
processing of platform data
complies with legal regulation
and user preference when retrieving
data over the internal APIs.
<!-- Our use case -->

The above requirements for 
automated integration of user age data
can be translated to decentralized
networks of data stores as follows,
under the assumption that relevant 
policies and data are in place:
(i) 
The service can discover user age data 
carrying sufficient and verifiable
proof of data integrity.
(ii) 
The user trusts their data store
to model and enforce their preferences
and relevant legal requirements 
depending on the context of an interaction.
(iii) 
The service can trust a successful retrieval
of data to provide sufficient information
on how this data can be stored and used
in compliance with user preference
and legal regulation.

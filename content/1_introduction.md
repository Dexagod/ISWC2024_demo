## Introduction

<!-- A move for making data available -->
In a 2009 Ted talk [](cite:cites berners-lee_tim_2009), sir Tim Berners Lee called
for "Raw Data Now" as a driver for data innovation on the Web.
<!-- Data sharing initiatives -->
Recent initiatives such as European Data Spaces
have adopted this approach, developing protocols
that enable interoperable digital marketplaces
on the Web [](cite:cites braud_road_2021). 
<!-- These initiatives mimic the big data incentives through storage and sharing -->
These initiatives focus on translating the
capabilities of Web platforms to store and 
share internally large volumes of private data 
towards decentralized networks of data stores.
<!-- But platforms rely on integration! -->
Parallel to handling large volumes of data, 
Web platforms are characterized by the
automated integration of this data they
enable for integrated services.
<!-- And this is largely ignored in decentralization efforts -->
This aspect on automated integration
of data has been largely ignored
in decentralized efforts, 
as these are not center to 
B2B data exchange needs [CITATION?!].
<!-- This work explores the required translation for such integration -->
With this work we explore the translation
of the requirements for such automated 
integration from an internal Web platform
perspective to a network of decentralized
data stores through the trust flows that
enable this automation.
<!-- Through a minimal demonstrator for such a network -->
We present a demonstration of such
a minimal network architecture
based on open Web standards that can
model these trust flows based on the
requirements of a sample use case.
